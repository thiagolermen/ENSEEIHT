# Variables
var Assignments{s in STORE, f in FLUID}, integer >= 0;

# Constants
param Commands{c in CLIENT,f in FLUID};
param Stocks{s in STORE, f in FLUID};

# Constraints
s.t. RespectCommands{f in FLUID}: sum{s in STORE} Assignments[s, f] = sum{c in CLIENT} Commands[c, f];

# Objective
minimize TotalCost:
