    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> As you know, a new epidemic has overwhelmed the world, COVID-19 jeopardizes people and changes our habits. It is easy to realise that knowing how illnesses spread is vital to our own protection. How can we predict whether a disease will cause an epidemic, how many people it will infect, which people it will infect, and whether or not it is dangerous to society as a whole ? Also, how can we determine which techniques to use in fighting an epidemic once it begins ? One way to answer all of these questions is through <strong>mathematical modeling</strong>. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> In this work you will have to review different epidemic modelings relying all on the representation by graphs of a human network called a <strong>contact network</strong>. A vertex in a contact network represents an individual and an edge between two vertices represents a contact between two individuals. The disease only spread from individual to individual if they are in contact, so through the edges. This representation is actually really common in research, and a lot of state-of-the-art modeling are built over it. From these different models you will be asked to draw conclusions from experiments on varying contact networks</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> For readability and ease of use, this project will be carried on a Jupyter Notebook, hence code and question answering have to be written in this unique file. This is a <strong>DUO</strong> project, no group of one person will be accepted, the duo has to be composed of same TD group students, if the number of students in the TD group is odd we will accept one group composed of three students. It will be coded in Julia using the LightGraphs package. <strong>BEWARE:</strong> \n",

Each vertex represents an individual in the host population, and contacts between two individuals are represented by an edge that connects the two. The probability of transmitting the disease from an infected to a susceptible individual along one of these edges or contacts is $\\beta$ (=<strong>infection rate</strong>).

First, each infected individual will spread disease to each of its contacts with a probability $\\beta$. Secondly, each infectious individual will recover at a rate, $\\alpha$ , at which point the individual will then no longer infect any of its contacts.

    "We can observe on the plots above that the degree is another essential parameter in the spreading (at least for the regular graphs). Indeed, for a giver spreading rate, the more the value of degree increases the more are chances that the percentage of infected people will not tend towards zero in case of diseases with relatively small spreading rates, the faster the spreading of infection is and the higher its final value is. Thus, these results confirm the pertinence of the isolation measures that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example.<br>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Unfortunately SIS model is valuable for diseases we can catch back since a cured person can get ill again. This is true for the flu, the cold, etc. However COVID-19 might create immunity for whom already got it and SIS can not take into account immune or dead persons. That is why we propose in this part to consider another model more adapted to COVID-19 called SIR. It stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered where the susceptible group contains those who remain susceptible to the infection, the infected group consists of those who not only have the disease but are also in the contagious period of the disease, and the recovered group contains those who were ill, got cured, are not contagious and can not get ill anymore.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> One limitation of SIR is that it does not model the reaction of humans when they feel the presence of the epidemic. Indeed, if feeling threaten or surrounded by infected, an individual may change its behaviors: wear mask, wash its hands, etc. This result in a smaller infection rate. That is why in this part we will also consider a variant of SIR called SAIR which stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Alert $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered. A susceptible individual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_0$, an infected individual recovers and gets immune by the curing rate $\\alpha$, an individual can observe the states of its neighbors, then a susceptible individual might go to the alert state if surrounded by infected individuals with an alert rate $\\kappa$ on each contact with an infected, an alert inividual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_1$ where $0<\\beta_1<\\beta_0$. In our simple SAIR model, an individual can not go back to a susceptible state when he got into the alert state.</p>\n",

    "We can observe that the \"infection\" curve is no more monotonous and increasing in values, but it has now a maximum of about 50% and then decreases monotonously tending toward zero. It is quite logical because, since the recovered status is a stable one, the percentage of recovered people can only grow with time (and it is the case here). It implies that the percentage of susceptible people decreases in general with time, which explains the presence of a maximum for the percentage of infected people followed by a monotonous decrease towards zero.\n",

    "The SAIR model being globally the finest and most realistic of the 3, we will only mention the defects and improvements for this model.<br>\n",
    "<strong>Limitations</strong>:<br>\n",
    "<u>SIS case</u>: \n",
    "Since we use the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters and people can assume only two values (healthy or infected), we do not account for the immunity potential of infected people, who after contracting the disease, become less susceptible to contracting the virus again.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<u>SIR case</u>:\n",
    "As defined, a person who contracts the disease once becomes immune to contracting the same disease again. This kind of approach is not always true, especially for COVID-19, because an individual who has already been infected, despite acquiring some immunity, can still contract the disease again.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<u>SAIR case</u>:\n",
    "Like the SIR model, the SAIR model does not consider that a recovered individual can still contract the disease. Besides, even if with the SAIR model the human reaction (alert state) is considered, the alert state should not be irreversible compared to the susceptible state, because in reality if a person knows that his/her contacts have all recovered, he/she tends to let his/her guards down (and thus returns to the susceptible state of the model).<br>\n",
    "<strong>Theoretical improvements</strong>:<br>\n",
    "1) To address the problem cited in the SIR and SAIR cases, we can establish a rate of possibility of reinfection of an already cured individual. This rate can be increased over time to represent the loss of immunity of a cured individual. This approach comes closer to reality, especially for the case of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Consider the mutations of disease viruses. Viruses mutate very frequently and infection rates tend to change. For this, you can create a model that considers the mutation of a virus in relation to infection rates, so for each of the mutated virus types, we can have a different infection rate for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Consider the time of year when the disease is spreading. This can be an important factor, because at certain times of the year (such as in winter when there is less indoor air circulation) the infection rate for certain diseases is relatively higher (or lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Consider deaths of individuals. Diseases like COVID-19 with relatively high rates of hospitalizations followed by death, we can create a model that considers this type of situation by eliminating one node from the graph, which would represent a death of an individual.<br>\n",
    "<strong>Practical improvements</strong>:<br>\n",
    "We will now implement another model, which we called SAII, based on the SAIR which takes into account its limitations linked to the stability of the cured state and the irreversibility of the alert state, and fixes them.\n",

    "    \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> The stochastic nature of infection propagation makes the estimation of the epidemic origin intrinsically hard: indeed, different initial conditions can lead to the same configuration at the observation time. Methods such as the distance centrality or the Jordan center try to approximate it. They both rely on spatial information by stating that the first infected is probably at the center of the cluster of infection. Mathematically:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The jordan center is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\max_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)$ where $\\mathcal{I}$ is a connected component of the original contact network containing all infected and recovered vertices, and where $d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the distance (= the shortest path) between 2 vertices (if not weighted graph each edge accounts for 1 unit). \n",
    "* The distance centrality is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)(\\delta_{n,I} + \\delta_{n,R}/\\alpha)$, where $\\delta_{n,I}=1$ if the vertex n is infected ($=0$ otherwise), and where $\\delta_{n,R}=1$ if the vertex n is recovered ($=0$ otherwise). You may note that in distance centrality we increase the weight of the recovered vertices by a factor $1/\\alpha$, it translates the fact that recovered vertices tend to be closer to the origin of the epidemic since they probably got ill before.\n",
